# ESP32 and Waveshare 4.2 e-ink 3 colour display weather monitor

A revised version (fixed minor errors) of the Weather Display written by G6EJD,
and updated graphics to v2 of the 3 colour Waveshare e-ink display I am using.

This is still in development, need to;
* put the ESP32 to deep sleep
* find a battery/charger solution (e.g. different ESP32 board)
* have a 3D case made

This project was written using Visual Studio Code and the PlatformIO extension.

Libraries used: GxEPD2, ArduinoJson.
